# Happy New Year!
Happy new year to all!

## Usage
Open terminal and run

```bash
./run.sh
```

If the program isn't showing your name, then you need to update
the names.txt file. If you are the intended recipient
of this gift, then there should be a whacky file named similar to
your real name.  once you find your file run in the terminal:

```bash
cp <yourFileNam.txt> name.txt
```

ie:
```bash
cp captsar.txt name.txt
```

if there is no file for you, you can always just edit the
name.txt file in your favorite editor, obviously vim.
